There are two types of categorical variables: a nominal categorical variable and an ordinal categorical variable.

A nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order.
This means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'. 
For example, think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories "Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey" and "Horse". 
Here, it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other. (Note that some of you might disagree ;-) ).

In contrast, ordinal variables do have a natural ordering. 
Consider for example the categorical variable temperature_vector with the categories: "Low", "Medium" and "High".
Here it is obvious that "Medium" stands above "Low", and "High" stands above "Medium".
